NAME
    vcardtidy - normalize the format of VCARD files

VERSION
    v0.0.0 (yyyy-mm-dd)

SYNOPSIS
        vcardtidy [FILES...] [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
    vcardtidy formats VCARD files, using Text::vCard::Addressbook to
    normalize field order and capitalization.

    By default vcardtidy acts like a filter, reading from "stdin" and
    writing to "stdout".

    If "FILES..." are specified they are tidied up in place! Users are
    encouraged to use a revision control system (e.g. Git) and/or have
    secure backups.

OPTIONS
    --filter, -F PERL
        Before tidying, evaluate the "PERL" string with $_ set to the
        input text. The modified $_ value then input to
        Text::vCard::Addressbook for tidying.

        To add an additional category for example:

            $ vcardtidy untidy.vcf \
               -F 's/^END:VCARD/CATEGORIES:\nEND:VCARD/m
                     unless m/^CATEGORIES:/m' \
               -F 's/^(CATEGORIES:\S+)(\s+)$/\1,\2/m' \
               -F 's/^(CATEGORIES:.*)(\s+)$/\1NewCat\2/m'

        Tools like sed(1), awk(1) and of course perl(1) are obviously
        natively designed to modify text, in a better way. But
        "--filter" ensures that you still have a valid VCARD afterwards,
        allowing you to easily iterate while you develop your change.

    --force, -f
        Force a tidy to occur when the N or FN fields are missing, by
        creating them based on the card's UID.

        This flag can also be used to overwrite the VERSION field or
        ensure the the REV field is updated.

    --help, -h
        Print the full usage message and exit.

    --no-rev, -R
        Prevent vcardtidy from updating the "REV" timestamp.

    --nothing, -n
        Do not write tidied output to files. In filter mode outputs the
        original VCARD.

    --vcard-version, -v VERSION
        The value of VERSION to update (with "--force") or add (when
        none exists). Defaults to "4.0".

    --version, -V
        Print the version and exit.
