NAME
    vcardtidy - normalize the format of VCARD files

VERSION
    v0.0.0 (yyyy-mm-dd)

SYNOPSIS
        vcardtidy [FILES...] [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
    vcardtidy formats VCARD files, using Text::vCard::Addressbook to
    normalize field order and capitalization.

    By default vcardtidy acts like a filter, reading from "stdin" and
    writing to "stdout".

    If "FILES..." are specified they are tidied up in place! Users are
    encouraged to use a revision control system (e.g. Git) and/or have
    secure backups.

OPTIONS
    --debug, -d
        Output debugging statements to STDERR.

    --regex, -r REGEX
        Before tidying, evaluate "REGEX" replacement expression against
        the input. Can be used multiple times. To add a NOTE and an
        additional CATEGORY in one go for example:

            $ vcardtidy untidy.vcf \
               -r 's/^END:VCARD/NOTE:My note\r\nEND:VCARD/m'
               -r 's/^(CATEGORIES:.*)(\s+)$/\1,NewCategory\2/m'

        Tools like sed(1), awk(1) and of course perl(1) are obviously
        natively designed to modify text, in a better way. But "--regex"
        ensures that you still have a valid VCARD afterwards, allowing
        you to easily iterate while you develop your change.

    --force, -f
        Force a tidy to occur when the N or FN fields are missing, by
        creating them based on the card's UID.

        This flag can also be used to overwrite the VERSION field or
        ensure the the REV field is updated.

    --help, -h
        Print the full usage message and exit.

    --no-rev, -R
        Prevent vcardtidy from updating the "REV" timestamp.

    --nothing, -n
        Do not write tidied output to files. In filter mode outputs the
        original VCARD.

    --vcard-version, -v VERSION
        The value of VERSION to update (with "--force") or add (when
        none exists). Defaults to "4.0".

    --version, -V
        Print the version and exit.
